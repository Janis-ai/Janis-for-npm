# [Janis](https://developer.Janis.ai)
## For Chatbots Built in Node.js

Artificial intelligence is only as good as the training it receives.  With Janis, you can train and monitor your AI from Slack to accelerate automation and reduce time and costs associated with customer service.

* Train
Define and categorize what users say and your responses. Simulate bot conversations in a dedicated Slack channel and only go live when you're confident in your automation.

* Monitor
Get alerts when a human should take over. Pause your bot and chat live with customers, while training your AI to learn from your conversations so you can improve for the future.

* Gain Insights
See where your AI needs more training with analytics, then measure the impact of additional training on key performance metrics.

### What you need to get started:
* [Janis for Slack](https://slack.janis.ai)
* [A Chatbot built in Node.js](./examples/)
* [Optional: An API.AI account](http://www.api.ai) 
(Other AI sources such as wit.ai are on the roadmap, but you can still use other features to monitor and manage your AI until then)

##### Operational Dependencies:
1.  You'll need an API key from Janis and a Client Key for each Chatbot you register with Janis.  You can get both of those (free) when you add Janis to Slack. 
2.  If you're building a Messenger Chatbot, you'll need to setup a Facebook App, Facebook Page, get the Page Access Token from Facebook and link the Facebook App to the Facebook Page for Janis to work. This is standard for any Chatbot you build for Messenger.

Note: This module has been tested with Messenger, Slack, Skype, and Microsoft Webchat. Please see our [examples](./examples/).

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save janis
```


### Usage

```javascript
var janis = require('janis');
var apiKey = process.env.JANIS_API_KEY; // <= key provided by janis for Slack
var clientKey = process.env.JANIS_CLIENT_KEY; // <= key provided by janis for Slack
var botPlatform = 'messenger'; // <= possible values: 'messenger', 'slack', 'microsoft'
var token = process.env.PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN; // <= only required for Messenger bots.
var janis = janis(apiKey, clientKey, {platform: botPlatform, token:token});
```
##### Incoming Message Schema:
Throughout this documentation, you will see references to `incomingMessage`. Depending on whether you have a Messenger or Slack bot, the schema will be different. The value of `incomingMessage` should be equal to the message you receive directly from either the Messenger webhook response, or from the Slack RTM event response.

```javascript
// Example of a Slack Incoming Message
{
    "type": "message",
    "channel": "D024BE91L",
    "user": "U2147483697",
    "text": "Hello world",
    "ts": "1355517523.000005"
}

// Example of a Messenger Incoming Message
{
  "sender":{
    "id":"USER_ID"
  },
  "recipient":{
    "id":"PAGE_ID"
  },
  "timestamp":1458692752478,
  "message":{
    "mid":"mid.1457764197618:41d102a3e1ae206a38",
    "seq":73,
    "text":"hello, world!",
    "quick_reply": {
      "payload": "DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD"
    }
  }
}  
```

##### Outgoing Message Schema:
Throughout this documentation, you will see references to `outgoingMessage`. Depending on whether you have a Messenger or Slack bot, the schema, as defined by each platform, will be different. Every time you track an outgoing message, the schema requirements match the respective platform.

```javascript
// Example of Slack Outgoing Message
{
    "channel": "C024BE91L",
    "text": "Hello world"
}

// Exmaple of Messenger Outgoing Message
{
  "recipient":{
    "id":"USER_ID"
  },
  "message":{
    "text":"hello, world!"
  }
}
```

##### Tracking received messages:

When your bot receives an incoming message, you'll need to log the data with janis by calling to `janis.hopIn`. 
__Note__: janis can pause your bot so that it doesn't auto response while a human has taken over. The callback from your `hopIn` request will pass the `isBotPaused` Bool value. If true, use that to stop your bot from responding to an incoming message. Here is an example:

```javascript
// Let janis know when a message comes in 
janis.hopIn(incomingMessage, function(isBotPaused) {
    // If your bot is paused, stop it from replying
    if (isBotPaused) { return };
    // Process incoming message
    ...
```
__Note for Botkit users__: If you are using Botkit, you do not need to call to `hopIn`. Instead, you can add the janis middleware. Then your message object will have a `paused` property. Here's an example:
```javascript
controller.middleware.receive.use(janis.receive);
// reply to a direct message
controller.on('direct_message', function (bot, message) {
    // If your bot is paused, stop it from replying
    if (message.paused) { return };
    // Process incoming message
    ...
```


##### Tracking sent messages:

Each time your bot sends a message, make sure to log that with janis by calling to `janis.hopOut`. Here is an example of a function that we're calling `sendIt` that tracks an outgoing message and at the same time, has the bot say the message:
```javascript
var sendIt = function(outgoingMessage) {
    janis.hopOut(outgoingMessage);
    bot.say(outgoingMessage); // <= example of bot sending reply
    ...
```
__Note__: If you are using Botkit, you do not need to call to `hopOut`. Instead, you can add the following middleware:
```
controller.middleware.send.use(janis.send);
```

##### Log Unknown Intents:

Find the spot in your code your bot processes incoming messages it does not understand. Within that block of code, call to `janis.logUnkownIntent` to capture these conversational ‘dead-ends’. Here's an example:

```javascript
// let the user know that the bot does not understand
var outgoingMessage = {'channel':channel,'text':'Huh?'}; // <= Schema matches Slack
sendIt(outgoingMessage);
// capture conversational dead-ends.
janis.logUnknownIntent(incomingMessage);
```
##### Dial 0 to Speak With a Live Human Being:

janis can trigger alerts to suggest when a human should take over for your Chatbot. To enable this, create an intent such as when a customer explicitly requests live assistance, and then include the following lines of code where your bot listens for this intent:

```javascript
// match an intent to talk to a real human
if (text == 'help') {
    // let the user know that they are being routed to a human
    var outgoingMessage = {'channel':channel,'text':'Hang tight. Let me see what I can do.'};  // <= Schema matches Slack
    sendIt(outgoingMessage);
    // send a janis alert to your slack channel
    // that the user could use assistance
    janis.assistanceRequested(incomingMessage);
```

##### Human Take Over:

To enable the ability to have a human take over your bot, add the code below to subscribe to the 'chat response' event. Alternatively, if you'd prefer to use a webhook to receive the payload, please get in touch with us at support@janis.ai and we can enable that for you.

```javascript
// Handle forwarding the messages sent by a human through your bot
janis.on('chat response', function (outgoingMessage) {
    bot.say(outgoingMessage);  // <= example of bot sending message
});
```

Go back to Slack and wait for alerts. That's it!
